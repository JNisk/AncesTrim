# Summary

AncesTrim (Niskanen et al. 2017) is a Python tool for trimming complex pedigrees. Some pedigree data
can have an inherently complicated structure with a high level of inbreeding, which makes
visualization of such data difficult. AncesTrim reduces the complexity of pedigrees while
preserving critical relatedness structures, allowing the pedigree to be displayed in a more
efficient way.
